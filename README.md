# IOWho

IOWho was a React application I developed back in 2016 as a small side-project to help me learn and understand
the ReactJS and Redux synergy. It's backend-less and persists data using the browser's LocalStorage.

The goal of IOWho was to provide a stupidly simple web app to keep track of the things we oweâ€” either money we
owe someone, or that someone owes you. Think: *"I Owe Who?"*

I left the project in more or less the same state it was after the last commit in late 2016.
I held onto the domain and have now published the app to Netlify at: [https://iowho.com](https://iowho.com).

It's very interesting to see both how quickly the JavaScript world has been moving the last few years, but
also what's still familiar.

### The future of IOWho?

I may still consider adding features, such as something I wanted right from the very start: user creation and
backend data persistence; essential features for a more serious web app. The codebase as it is also needs some love
to bring up to date all those old dependencies & clunky build pipeline, not to mention the complete lack of unit tests.
